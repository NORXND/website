# NORXND's Official Website

Official website visible at https://norxnd.cf made with React.
The website is still unfinished and may contain various typos. Sorry for that.
This project includes things such as localization or auto-generation of header menu.
I am not accepting any PRs that for example change things such as about me text (unless it's a typo) or contacts and social media since it's obviously my website. ;)
It's my first React project so be awere.

## Update as of 22.09.2022

As my current server contract has ended and I cannot renew it as I was able to do it before, I have no place to host my websites and other stuff. Right now, I'm in process of searching for a new server to buy.
For now, a temporary website (located in `tmp` branch) will be hosted at GitHub Pages.
