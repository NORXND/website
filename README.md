# NORXND's Official Website

Official website visible at https://norxnd.cf made with React.
The website is still unfinished and may contain various typos. Sorry for that.
This project includes things such as localization or auto-generation of header menu.
I am not accepting any PRs that for example change things such as about me text (unless it's a typo) or contacts and social media since it's obviously my website. ;)
It's my first React project so be awere.
