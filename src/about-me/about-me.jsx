              I'm NORXND, also known by my real name Norbert. I'm a 15-year-old
              guy living in Koszalin, Poland.
              <br></br>
              I'm a hobbyist programming student. I also sometimes produce music
              and make graphics (You could notice I'm obsessed with CANAL+ and
              other Ã‰tienne Robial's work).
              <br></br>
              I'm programming in Python, Lua (and Luau), C# and know the basics
              of JS, I can also do websites both in the traditional way or in
              React. In the future, I want to become a freelancer software
              developer, create games and apps to make people happy.<br></br>I
              sometimes play some games like FE2 (on Roblox), GTA V, Portal 2,
              Subnautica or something else.
              <br></br>You probably know me because I'm a friend of the founder
              and former owner of the popular Roblox game. In 2021, I worked
              with him in the "Inertia" games studio which was eventually
              closed.
              <br></br>From 2020 to this day I'm the director of{" "}
              <a href="https://chojrakdev.cf/">Chojrak Development</a> studio.
              There, I work on Neotrax, a new alternative for certain Roblox
              game I mentioned above.<br></br>
              For now, I'm not open for commissions or jobs but soon, I plan to
              open a website-making commission (Stay tuned for that!).<br></br>
