I also sometimes produce music and make graphics (You could notice I'm obsessed with CANAL+ and other Ã‰tienne Robial's work).<3 />I'm programming in Python, Lua (and Luau), C# and know the basics of JS, I can also do websites both in the traditional way or in React. In the future, I want to become a freelancer software developer, create games and apps to make people happy <5 />I sometimes play some games like FE2 (on Roblox), GTA V, Portal 2, Subnautica or something else.<7 />You probably know me because I'm a friend of the founder and former owner of the popular Roblox game. In 2021, I worked with him in the \"Inertia\" games studio which was eventually closed.<9 />From 2020 to this day I'm the director of <12>Chojrak Development </12> studio. There, I work on Generation Trains, a new alternative for certain Roblox game I mentioned above.<15 />For now, I'm not open for commissions or jobs but soon, I plan to open a website-making commission (Stay tuned for that!).<17 /> What am I doing right now? Check the <19>Work</19> page. Where can you find me? Check the <23>Socials</23> page.<25 />I'm a furry. Yes.<27 />That's all that you should know about me, I think so at least.
